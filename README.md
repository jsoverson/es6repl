es6repl
-------

This is a minimally adapted version of @zenparsing's esdown
repl intended for use as an iframe for blogging/documentation purposes.

## Usage

* Go to [the repl](http://jsoverson.github.io/es6repl)
* Type in the code you want to display by default
* Enter `.link` in the repl
* Copy the link for distribution or iframe embedding.

## Differences from esdown repl

* Generated links are executed command-by-command vs as a whole program.
* Styled to be more amenable to embedding.
